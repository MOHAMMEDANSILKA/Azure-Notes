Integration Runtime (IR) is the compute and networking layer used by Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Synapse Pipelines to move, transform, and connect data across different environments.

Think of it as the engine that actually executes your data integration tasks.

Why Integration Runtime is needed

Whenever you:

Copy data (on-prem → cloud, cloud → cloud)

Run data flows

Connect to private networks

Access on-prem databases

👉 Integration Runtime does the work

Without IR, pipelines cannot execute.
